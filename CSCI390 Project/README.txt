Due to a problem with Juyter Notebook, I was unable to make much progress on writing the actual code for this project.
Inflectors.ipynb is the main program. If it worked, you would need to put Plotz Declension.xlsx in the same folder. 
Rule application test.ipynb was a test to make sure the problem was with Jupyter Notebook instead of with my code. It did not run on my
computer, but ran succesfully on Prof. Ghosh's. Nested Dictionary Test.ipynb was a test that proved that Jupyter Notebook had trouble
running code besides my rule interpretation function.
